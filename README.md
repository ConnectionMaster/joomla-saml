LastPass Joomla SAML Plugin
===========================

The LastPass Joomla SAML Plugin enables SAML 2.0 single-sign-on
to Joomla! by acting as a SAML Service Provider.  It is based on
the SimpleSAMLphp library.  The plugin is released under the
GPL; please see LICENSE.txt for details.

What do I need to use it?
-------------------------

You will need a recent version of Joomla.  This plugin has been
tested with Joomla 3.2.3.

You will also need a SAML IdP provider.  If you do not have one,
we suggest our own IdP service, part of LastPass Enterprise,
at https://lastpass.com/.

Installation
------------

Please see the INSTALL file for details on installation.  If
you are installing from the source repository, first run
`make_pkg.sh` to create the installation package.
