This plugin adds SAML 2.0 login support to Joomla! 3.2.  It is based on
the simplesamlphp library.

Please use a test instance until comfortable with the process, to ensure you
do not get locked out from your production servers.

1. Go to Extensions -> Extension Manager in the Joomla administrator
   console, click Install, and upload the zip file containing the plugin.

   Note, for some installations, you may need to edit the php.ini to
   increase the upload_max_filesize in order to accomodate the size
   of this plugin.  Alternately, you may install from a local directory
   or URL.

2. Click Extensions -> Plugin Manager, then click
   'Authentication - LastPass SAML' to configure the plugin.

 - Set IdP Entity-Id to match the entity ID used by your identity provider
 - Set SAML Login URL to match the SSO Login endpoint of your identity provider
 - Set SAML Logout URL to match the SSO Logout endpoint of your identity
   provider
 - Set Public Key X.509 Certificate to match the certificate from your identity
   provider
 - Adjust Ordering on the right-hand side as desired.  It is advisable to set
   it after "Authentication - Joomla" so that existing Joomla logins (e.g. for
   admin) will continue to work.
 - Set the plugin to Enabled
 - Save these settings

3. Configure the IdP on the identity provider side.  This depends on the
   provider.  For LastPass, visit
   https://lastpass.com/enterprise_saml.php?service=generic and add a new
   configuration as follows:

  - Select the appropriate user groups to have access to the site
  - Set Entity ID to LastPass:Joomla:https://yoursite.com/path/to/joomla/
  - Set Assertion Consumer Service to
    https://yoursite.com/path/to/joomla/plugins/authentication/lpsaml/simplesamlphp/www/module.php/saml/sp/saml2-acs.php/default-sp
  - Click 'Update'
  - (Optional) use the SAML Usermap link to map your LastPass logins to
    existing Joomla accounts.  For users without Joomla accounts, they will be
    automatically created if you have that option enabled in Joomla
    (Plugin Manager -> User - Joomla! -> Auto-create Users, on by default).

  For other identity providers:

  - SP Entity ID is LastPass:Joomla:https://yoursite.com/path/to/joomla/
  - SP Assertion Consumer Service is https://yoursite.com/path/to/joomla/plugins/authentication/lpsaml/simplesamlphp/www/module.php/saml/sp/saml2-acs.php/default-sp
  - You must edit joomla/plugins/authentication/lpsaml/simplesamlphp/config/authsources.php
    and change idp to set the IdP entity ID appropriately.

4. Now, go back to a Joomla login prompt (administrator or site login) and
   click the login button with any username/password.  You should be redirected
   to the IdP, and then back to Joomla as that user, once authenticated.
